## RIGIDSHIELD v1

This is a disposable and/or reusable face shield design, that is 95% laser cut.

It's based strongly on a design from a US university that I can no longer find. If it's yours please raise a pull request so I can attribute it properly!

Our modifications based on hospital feedback have included:

1) Increasing the wrap of the shield

2) Adding a top cover to help reduce liquid penetration to the face

3) Changing the arm details to reduce a failure point on the acrylic and increase the range of head sizes it fits.

4) Adding an optional adhesive foam strip to the headband to make it more comfortable

5) Changing to 3mm Acrylic to make it lighter, cheaper and faster to cut

**Note that this is not an approved medical or protective device and has not been tested or certified as fit for any restricted use.**

## Sterilising protocol
Bleaching is recomended.  
Not suitable for repeated Alcohol sanitisation, acrylic is typically ok in 30% or less alchol solutions but is prone to cracking at higher concentrations.

Ideally the rubber bumper and rubber band would be replaced each use.

## Lifespan:
Single or Multiple use depending on sterilising protocol used.
